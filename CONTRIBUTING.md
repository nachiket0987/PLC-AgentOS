## 📋 Contribution Guidelines

### Industrial Example Submissions

When contributing industrial examples:

#### ✅ What We Want
- **Production-Tested Code**: Systems that have been validated in real industrial environments
- **Complete Documentation**: Clear explanations of system operation and safety procedures
- **Safety Compliance**: Code following industrial safety standards (IEC 61508, IEC 61511)
- **Realistic Scenarios**: Real-world problems and solutions
- **Multiple Complexity Levels**: Simple to advanced implementations

#### ❌ What to Avoid
- **Theoretical Examples**: Untested academic exercises
- **Incomplete Code**: Missing safety interlocks or error handling
- **Proprietary Information**: Company-specific or confidential implementations
- **Unsafe Practices**: Code that doesn't follow safety standards

### Code Quality Standards

#### ST Code Requirements
```st
// ✅ Good Example
PROGRAM Water_Pump_Control
VAR
    pump_run: BOOL := FALSE;
    pump_feedback: BOOL := FALSE;
    emergency_stop: BOOL := FALSE;
    start_button: BOOL := FALSE;
END_VAR

// Safety interlock - highest priority
IF emergency_stop THEN
    pump_run := FALSE;
ELSIF start_button AND NOT pump_feedback THEN
    pump_run := TRUE;
END_IF;

END_PROGRAM
```

#### Documentation Standards
- **Clear Purpose**: Explain what the system controls
- **Safety Notes**: Document all safety considerations
- **Operation Description**: How the system works
- **Testing Procedures**: How to validate the code
- **Real-World Context**: Where this would be used

### Agent Prompt Guidelines

When improving agent prompts:

#### Structure Requirements
```markdown
## Agent Configuration
**Subagent Type:** general-purpose
**Description:** [Clear, specific description]

## Prompt Template
[Detailed prompt with clear instructions]

## Usage Example
[Specific example of how to use the agent]
```

#### Quality Criteria
- **Specificity**: Clear, actionable instructions
- **Industrial Context**: Understanding of PLC programming needs
- **Error Handling**: Guidance for edge cases and failures
- **Safety Awareness**: Industrial safety considerations
- **Consistency**: Compatible with other agents in the framework

### Code Comments
```st

PROGRAM Chemical_Dosing_System
VAR
    // Safety interlocks

    chemical_leak_detected: BOOL := FALSE;  // Gas detection system
    
    // Process variables
    ph_measurement: REAL := 7.0;            // pH sensor (4-20mA scaled)
    chemical_pump: BOOL := FALSE;           // Dosing pump output
    
    // Control parameters
    target_ph: REAL := 7.2;                // Process setpoint
    dosing_rate: REAL := 0.0;              // ml/min dosing rate
END_VAR

// SAFETY: Emergency shutdown takes precedence over all operations
IF emergency_stop OR chemical_leak_detected THEN
    chemical_pump := FALSE;
    dosing_rate := 0.0;
    // Activate emergency ventilation, shutdown procedures, etc.
ELSE
    // Normal pH control operation
    // ... control logic here
